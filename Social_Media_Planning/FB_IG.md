**Access and Control**
 - We have full access for Facbook page, but not Instagram page
 - Kevin O'Brien is an admin of the Facebook page and can reconfigure the page.
 - For Instagram - 2FA access is probably required to take direct control of the Why R? Instagram page.
 - In the meantime posts can be published using Meta Business Suite.

### Recommended Instagram Image Sizes

|Post Type | Optimal Dimensions (pixels) | Aspect Ratio |
|Square Post | 1080 × 1080 | 1:1 |
|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Portrait Post | 1080 × 1350 | 4:5 |
| Landscape Post | 1080 × 566 | 1.91:1 | 
| Story / Reel | 1080 × 1920 | 9:16 |

For maximum impact and flexibility, 1080 × 1350 (portrait) is often preferred—it takes up more vertical space in the feed and draws more attention.
However, if you're matching the dimensions of your original image (which appears square), 1080 × 1080 is ideal and universally supported.
