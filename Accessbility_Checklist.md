### 1.2 Public Transport

Warsaw in 2026 is a study in "modern inclusivity." The **Public Transport (ZTM)**  system's infrastructure has been rebuilt with a focus on accessibility.

* * **Buses & Trams:** 100% of the bus fleet and almost all modern trams are low-floor. Look for the wheelchair icon on timetables (often in square brackets).

* **Metro:** Both lines M1 and M2 are fully accessible with elevators at every station. There is no "gap" to bridge between the platform and the train.

* **Main Interchanges:** Stations like *Warszawa Centralna* have dedicated assistance staff. You can call +48 22 474 60 16 to arrange a guide or ramp assistance for trains.

---

### 1.3 Conference Venues

* **University of Warsaw:** The main campus is largely accessible, with paved paths and ramps. The "BON" (Office for Persons with Disabilities) provides specific digital maps and on-site support.
* 
* **SGH (School of Economics):** The main "G" building is barrier-free. It features a "glass elevator" specifically adapted for wheelchairs and a "Parachute Hall" ramp to navigate level changes.

* **The "Old Town" Caveat:** While the Royal Route is manageable, the inner Old Town is famous for original cobblestones. Suggest attendees use the "smooth" stone paths usually laid on the edges of the sidewalks.


---

### 1.4 The Berlin-Warsaw Express Accessibility

* **Boarding:** Since Polish platforms can vary in height, the train uses a manual or hydraulic lift.

* **Pre-booking:** For travelers from Berlin, you must notify the **DB Mobility Service Centre** or **PKP Intercity** 24–48 hours in advance.

* **Onboard:** There is a dedicated carriage with an oversized accessible toilet and a specialized wheelchair parking area with power outlets.


---

### 1.5 Visual & Sensory Accessibility Off-Site

* **"Virtual Warsaw" (IoT Beacons):** The city uses thousands of Bluetooth beacons (via the **YourWay** or **Virtual Warsaw** apps). These provide micro-navigation, announcing bus stop names and museum room descriptions directly to a smartphone.

* **Tactile Navigation:** * **Yellow "Blister" Tiles:** Installed at all Metro platforms and major bus stops to signal the edge.

* **Braille Signage:** Standard in all Metro elevators and on modern SGH and University building doors.

* **Audio Assistance:** * **Public Transit:** All new vehicles feature voice announcements for current and upcoming stops.

* **TOTUPOINT:** A specialized system at airports and SGH that uses audio signals to help blind users locate specific points like elevators or information desks.

## 3. Accessible Accomodation and Off-Sites Activities

### 3.1 Accommodation & District Highlights

* **Museums (POLIN & National Museum):** These offer "typhlographics"—tactile models of exhibits and architectural layouts—along with high-quality audio description tours.

* **Praga (Hotel Hetman area):** While the area is historic, the recent "Revitalization of Praga" program has added dropped curbs and improved paving to the main thoroughfares.
* **Mokotów (SGH area):** This is arguably the most accessible district for "wheeling" as it is flat, has wide sidewalks, and features newer residential developments.

**Action Item:** Find the specific contact links for the **University of Warsaw’s BON office**
